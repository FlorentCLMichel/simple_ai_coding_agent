A simple coding agent, based on the [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-an-ai-coding-agent-with-python-and-gemini/). 

**Warning:** This implementation is meant for educational purpose only. It does not come with any security or performance guarantees.

To run the code, you will need to create a file `.env` with containing:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your Genini API key>
MODEL=<model to use>
```

See the [Gemini API doc](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) for how to [create and use API keys](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and a [list of available models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models).
